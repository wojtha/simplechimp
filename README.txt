== Questions

Why this module isn't hosted on Drupal.org?

Author of this module respects the rule from Drupal Standards: there should be only one
module with given functionality hosted on Drupal.org and there is also the rule saying
that module which is only simpler version of some more complex module should be
abandoned.
